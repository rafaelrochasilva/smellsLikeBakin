# Smells Like Bakin
Smells Like Bakin is a Cup Cake web site sample. It was build in 2013 following [Team Tree House](www.teamtreehouse.com) tutorial. I decided to refactory the project and include Sinatra with ActionMailer to handle the emails delivery. I also will implement a payment adapter to handle cupcakes selling.
