# Smells Like Bakin
Smells Like Bakin is a cup cake web site sample. It was build initialy in 2013
following (Team Tree House)[www.teamtreehouse.com] tutorial to help me learn 
css and html. I decided to refactory the project and include sinatra with 
ActionMailer to handle the emails. I also will implement a payment adapter to 
handle cupcakes selling.
